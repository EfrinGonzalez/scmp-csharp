Business Rules Engine: Rules managed by the new system.

1.If the payment is for a physical product, generate a packing slip for shipping.

2.If the payment is for a book, create a duplicate packing slip for the royalty department.

3.If the payment is for a membership, activate that membership.

4.If the payment is an upgrade to a membership, apply the upgrade.

5.If the payment is for a membership or upgrade, e-mail the owner and inform them of the activation/upgrade.

6.If the payment is for the video “Learning to Ski,” add a free “First Aid” video to the packing slip (the result of a court decision in 1997).

7.If the payment is for a physical product or a book, generate a commission payment to the agent. Design a new system which can handle these rules and yet open to extension to new rules
